LLM - (large language model) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is trained on a large corpus of
text data to generate human-like language. LLMs are designed to understand and respond to natural language
input, and are often used in applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation tools.

transformer - A type of neural network architecture that is commonly used in LLMs. The transformer architecture
is designed to handle sequential data, such as text, and is particularly well-suited for tasks such
as language.

temperature - A hyperparameter that controls the level of randomness in the output of a LLM. Lower temperatures
result in more deterministic output, while higher temperatures result in more random output.
usually b/w 0-5 or 0-2
